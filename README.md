# Uncommon HTML Error: Missing meta charset and Incorrect head tag order

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error in HTML related to the missing `charset` attribute in the `<meta>` tag and an incorrect order of tags within the `<head>` section.

The issue is that the closing `</head>` tag appears before the `<title>` tag which is against standards, although some browsers might still render the page.

The solution involves adding the correct `charset` attribute to the `<meta>` tag and ensuring the order is correct, placing `<title>` and other head elements *before* closing the head section.
